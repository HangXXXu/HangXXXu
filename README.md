I am an architecture designer, building scientist, and researcher with professional experience in architectural practice across Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing.

Currently I am a Ph.D. student at Sustainable Urban Systems Lab, under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Kastner at Georgia Tech, pursuing sustainability in the built environment by integrating high-performance building strategies, eco-friendly urban design, and advanced computational technologies.

I was previously a research assistant at Tsinghua University, focus on green building design and research. I also hold a M.S. in Sustainable Architecture Studies from the University of Sheffield, UK.

My research interest:

 * Urban Building Energy Modeling (UBEM)
 * Surrogate Model for Building and Environmental Simulation
 * Artificial Intelligence in Architectural Design
